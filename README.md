How do I approach designing software?

The best way I have found to design software is using and iterative approach. Taking the project and breaking it down into smaller, more managable sections is best. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have definitely realized just how much work goes into generating gfraphics and designing scenes with multiple shapes and textures. it is something I intend to pursue even after this class.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

Build and test. I would add a feature and test it. I tried not to get too far ahead of myself as this makes things more complicated when issues arise. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Any new projects will be handled in a similar fashion. Taking the requirements given and building the project iteratively and testing often. 

How do I approach developing programs?

Similarly to building this project. Knowing that many projects will be developed in a teat environment, it is critical to take an iterative approach and test often.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

One strategy I employed was collaboration. By that I mean reaching out for help and working with others to try and solve the issues at hand. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

It was pretty much everyhting in this project. All the requirement were developed independtly and tested in that manner. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I will say that it is easy to get overwhelmed with each little detail. I found myself trying to solve different issues all at once. This made it clear that handling each section independently and testing frequently is important.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I work in aviation simulation and technology. Computer Science is at the core of what we do. The more I learn about it, the better I can do my job. I am looking forward to advancing in this industry.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I will be better able to communicate with the visual database technicians and possibly assist in some of the modifications and updates that occur on a regular basis.
